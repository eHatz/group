Preject Description:
The app will be a meme making app which allows users to take a picture where they are, make a meme with the picture by adding customizable text and pin it to google maps for everyone to see. We will also try to add a voting/like system to the images and possibly use the stormpath api to help make users and connect the images to other social media.

Sketch of Final Product:

	Page 1: Search bars for location, google maps api interactive image, fields for adding an image and fields for adding text to the image
	
	Page 2: Profile page which list all posts user has made and possibly all posts user has liked

	Page 3: Popular memes in the area or world.

API's used:
google maps, stormpath, meme generator, geolocation

Breakdown of tasks:

Tim: work with manipulating the google maps API specifically adding pins to certain locations
Viren: work with the meme generator API
Kyla: start designing the front end, and upload a basic layout as soon as possible
